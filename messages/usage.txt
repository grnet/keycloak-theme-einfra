Just add in this folder any properties file with the format
messages_xx.properties, where xx is the language 2-digit code
i.e.  messages_es.properties for spanish translations, messages_pt.properties for portuguese translations, etc

This usage.txt file is neutral, meaning that it does not affect in any way the theme, so you can safely let it exist here!
